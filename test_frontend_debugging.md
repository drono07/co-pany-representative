# Frontend Debugging Guide

## üîç What I Fixed

1. **Fixed `getParentChildPath` function** - Now uses actual parent-child relationships data from API instead of simple heuristics
2. **Added debugging logs** - Console logs to track API calls and data flow
3. **Enhanced error handling** - Better error messages for debugging

## üöÄ How to Test the Fixes

### Step 1: Start Your Frontend
```bash
cd frontend
npm start
```

### Step 2: Log In
1. Go to `http://localhost:3000`
2. Log in with your credentials
3. Make sure you're authenticated

### Step 3: Navigate to Analysis Insights
1. Go to the analysis insights page for run ID: `68c02ad6b43a7f674e4d2103`
2. Open browser developer tools (F12)
3. Go to the **Console** tab

### Step 4: Check Console Logs
You should see these logs when the page loads:

```
Loading parent-child relationships for runId: 68c02ad6b43a7f674e4d2103
Parent-child relationships loaded: {parent_map: {...}, path_map: {...}}
```

### Step 5: Check Page Hierarchy Section
1. Scroll down to the "Page Hierarchy & Relationships" section
2. You should now see **Parent-Child Path** data instead of empty paths
3. Check console for logs like:
```
getParentChildPath called with URL: https://thegoodbug.com/collections/all
Navigation path for https://thegoodbug.com/collections/all: [...]
Formatted path result: [...]
```

### Step 6: Test View Info Buttons
1. Click any "View Info" button
2. Check console for logs:
```
Loading source code for: https://thegoodbug.com/collections/all
Source code data received: {source_code: "...", page_url: "...", ...}
```

## üêõ If You See Errors

### Authentication Errors (403/401)
- Make sure you're logged in
- Check if the JWT token is valid
- Try logging out and logging back in

### API Errors (404/500)
- Check if the run ID exists
- Verify the backend is running on port 8000
- Check network tab for actual API calls

### No Data Errors
- Check if parent-child relationships are loading
- Verify the run has the expected data (50 source codes, 226 relationships)

## üìä Expected Results

After the fixes, you should see:

1. **Page Hierarchy & Relationships** section shows actual parent-child paths
2. **View Info** buttons work and show source code
3. **Parent-Child Path** displays navigation paths like:
   ```
   Products ‚Äì thegoodbug ‚Üí Science ‚Äì thegoodbug
   ```

## üîß If Still Not Working

1. **Check Network Tab** - See what API calls are being made
2. **Check Console** - Look for error messages
3. **Verify Authentication** - Make sure you're logged in
4. **Check Backend** - Ensure FastAPI is running on port 8000

The backend is 100% working, so any issues are now in the frontend authentication or data flow.
